## 🗂️ Project Structure

-   `main.cpp`: Contains the entry point of the program and manages the overall simulation loop.
-   `circle.h`: Defines the `Circle` class, including properties like position, radius, velocity, and methods for movement and collision response.
-   `vector2.h`: Provides a `Vector2` class to represent 2D vectors, supporting essential mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, and dot products.

## 🚀 Getting Started
